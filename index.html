<p><b>Note: only eukaryotic cells have organelles.</b> <br> <br> <br> <br> These are the different types of organelles.<br> <br> <br> Cell Membrane: Keeps in good things for the cell and kicks things that are bad for the cell out.<br> 
<br> Cell Wall: Sturdy Protection only found in plant cells.<br> <br> Chloropast: Another organelle found in only plant cells, this organelle preforms photosynthesis.<br> <br> Mitochondria: Powerhouse of the cell. Generates sugars and protiens for the cell. <br> <br> Vacuole: A storage-like organelle for holding water and nutrients. <br> <br> Nucleus: Holds the DNA and controls the cell. <br> <br> Cytoplasm: a jelly-like substance that holds the organelles in place. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <b> Patrick Dooly - 10/1/2020</b> </p>
